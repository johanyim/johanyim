# Hi, I'm Johan

I'm a programmer with a passion for creating low-level utilities with simplicity and robustness. 
I am biased toward becoming better rather than reaching the solution, choosing to learn everything I know the long way.

I am an absolute minimalist in life and in programming. I believe that the simplest systems are the best. 

I have used Linux as my daily driver for years, becoming experienced in configuring and writing low-level programs. 


### Q: Why do you choose to use less than ~500MB of memory despite your 64GB of RAM on your machine.

I strive to create the most functional, minimalist linux system utilizing only the most lightweight components. No explanation.


### Languages: Rust, C, Bash, HTML, CSS

### Education: University of Bath MComp (Hons)
